With respect to India, that may be the case. The study was conducted by John Gibson, Gaurav Datt, Rinku Murgai, and Martin Ravallion and can be found in the [World Development journal][1]. Here is the abstract:

> We demonstrate that it is theoretically ambiguous whether growth of cities matters more to the rural poor than growth of towns. We then test empirically whether the economic growth of India’s secondary towns mattered more to recent rural poverty reduction than did growth of the big cities...For India’s current stage of development, growth of secondary towns may do more to reduce rural poverty than does big city growth although our theoretical model suggests that cities may eventually take over from towns as the drivers of rural poverty reduction.

I find it noteworthy the authors appear to hint at a distinction in conditions that may determine why the growth of Indian towns matter more than the growth of Indian cities, which considers the country's "current stage of [economic] development".
