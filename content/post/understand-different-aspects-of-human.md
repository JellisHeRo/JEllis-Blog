From Human Trafficking.org:

___Sex Trafficking___: Victims of sex trafficking are often found working in establishments that offer commercial sex acts, i.e. brothels, strip clubs, pornography production houses. Such establishments may operate under the guise of:

- Massage parlors
- Escort services
- Adult bookstores
- Modeling studios
- Bars/strip clubs

Not every person working in these establishments will have technically been trafficked. It would be necessary for trained authorities or service providers to interview each person individually to determine trafficking. 

___Labor Trafficking___: People forced into indentured servitude can be found in:

- Sweatshops (where abusive labor standards are present)
- Commercial agricultural situations (fields, processing plants, canneries)
- Domestic situations (maids, nannies)
- Construction sites (particularly if public access is denied)
- Restaurant and custodial work

Another kind of labor trafficking includes child soldiers. In over 40 countries across the globe, thousands of children are being forced or tricked into becoming soldiers. It is most known to be present in conflict-riddled African countries like [Somalia][1], [Sierra Leone][2], [Uganda][3], and [Sudan][4], but there are also known instances in Asian countries, like Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), which was believed to have had the [highest number of child soldiers][5] at one point. More from the site:

>___How Do People Get Trapped Into Sex or Labor Trafficking?___

>No one volunteers to be exploited. Traffickers frequently recruit people through fraudulent advertisements promising legitimate jobs as hostesses, domestics, or work in the agricultural industry. Trafficking victims of all kinds come from rural, suburban, and urban settings. There are signs when commercial establishments are holding people against their will.

Human Trafficking isn't just limited to sex and labor. Some kinds of human trafficking occur for the sake of transferring a victim's organs. Organ trafficking (for kidneys in particular) is a rapidly growing field of criminal activity. Kidney's are a high demand commodity, and these are the only major organs that can be wholly transplanted with relatively few risks to the life of the donor.
