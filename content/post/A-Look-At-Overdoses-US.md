[TIME magazine][1] used data from the Center of Disease Control to conjure up a temporal webmap of US drug overdoses at the county level.

This visualization is very telling: first thing I noticed is the obvious diffusion of drug overdoses across the country. Moving from 2002 to 2014, the country saw high instances of drug overdoses spread from areas in Nevada, Kentucky, West Virginia, California, and New Mexico to areas in neighboring states. It appears the activities in 2002 were strongest in Kentucky, West Virginia, Cali, and Nevada. The persistence of this epidemic is also worth noting. In 2002, about 8 states experienced over 20 drug overdoses within its borders. By 2014, that number pretty much quadrupled to 30 states with an overdose count above 20. Insane!
