The following video provides a brief look into supply and demand as it relates to retail clothing. It was probably a mistake for the uploader ([ehowbeauty][1]) to advertise supply and demand curves when there is none in the actual video, but if you're well familiar with the concepts, then you're fine.

Things that stood out in the video:

# 1. "Fashion forward"
If you were to ask me what this term meant, I would not have first guessed it as a term for successful innovation in fashion, and yet it is. More specifically, it is a term relating to the most up-to-date fashion trends, but this concept is not unfamiliar in economics. Before, I related "fashion forward" with "successful innovation", and it felt fitting because some "new" was introduced with respect to fashion styles, which start new kinds of fashion trends. 

# 2. Getting trendy
Following the introduction or "fashion forward" stage, Ms. Jimenez states that before a style becomes trendy, she made it clear that it has to be "accepted", which I found interesting because that is not to say that clothing is the only kind of product that has to face acception or rejection, but I would think that the nature of its acceptance or rejection differs from that of, say, a smartphone. More specifically, fashion is a form of individual expression, so whatever gets accepted or rejected, will recieve that based on, in part, how one wants to formulate that expression. With smartphones, acceptance and rejection is  determined by performance more than by mere aesthetics, even though there is evidence to back the notion that smartphones can be tied into individual identity as well.

# 3. Losing steam
When a clothing style loses steam in acceptance or popularity, sales decline and the clothing on its way out of the market get placed into Clearance sales.
